    <p>Free and open-soft software (FOSS) are allows users and programmers to edit, modify or reuses the software’s source code. The term “free” indicates that the software does not have constraints on copyrights. The term “open source” indicates the software is in its project form, enabling easy software developers the opportunity to improve program functionality by modifying it.</p>
    
    <p>When software is released under a free or open source license, I might do licensed software because I want to be ensured that my software projects to be maintain them when I wants them to be used.  Although this does not necessarily have to be the case to licensed software, but it’s better for some restrictions, regarding the expression of respect to the origin of software, such as a requirement to preserve the name of the authors and a copy right statement under the same license.</p>
